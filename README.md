# FinMath

A small & fun collection of short and basic python commands and scripts used in financial mathematics. 

These include: 
- Getting stock data for single/multiple stocks from yahoo and plotting them 
- Understanding the assumption of normally distributed returns
- Calculating returns and risks of stocks via ratios
- Calculating the beta of a stock and making a beta weighted portfolio

This code collection is to be taken as educational content. Written for my own purpose of understanding how to code some particular finmath things.
